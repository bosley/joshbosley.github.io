## About

I am a Computer Engineer that works on embedded systems in C/C++ and sometimes Rust. 

Currently most of my free time is spent working on the [Nabla Virtual Machine](https://nablavm.org). You should [check it out](https://github.com/NablaVM). 

## Research/ Project Experience :

***Autonomous Drone Control System*** (C++, OpenCV)

- Created novel tracking / following system using analysis of an active deformable model
- Implemented PID control law, Kalman filter, and flight-safety protocols
- Performed image filtering and analysis for target acquisition

***Active Deformable Model*** (C++, OpenCV, QT)

- Implemented an Active Deformable Model based on original research paper
- Wrote custom QT widgets working with OpenCV to create a demonstration GUI to interact with the underlying algorithms via image file, video file, or webcam

***Dynamic Network Overlay System*** (Python3)

- Network address translation bypassing scheme
- QT-inspired network signal / slot system enabling complex network If-this-then-that functionality
- Multi thread function encapsulation to handle trust-less code execution
- Cryptographic key usage for node registration and verification
